# Neurons, synapses, and sleep

Below is summarized some research regarding sleep and its effect on learning
or forgetting.

> Non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM) is characterized by high-voltage synchronized slow waves of electrical activity throughout the cortex, and is referred to as slow-wave sleep (SWS) in its most synchronized form.

> Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is characterized by rapid eye movement, muscle paralysis, and low-voltage irregular EEG waves similar to waves observed during wakefulness

> there is currently no clear evidence of an animal species that does not sleep

> the strongest experimental evidence supports a primary role for sleep in the regulation of brain plasticity and cognition.

> sleep promotes neural plasticity

> gains in memorization performance have also been reported after short sleep periods. Recall of events is stronger and more accurate after daytime nap as brief as a few minutes

>  SWS/NREM sleep deprivation after learning prevents subsequent consolidation and enhancement of memories. Consistent with this observation, stimulation of slow wave oscillations during sleep enhances the retention of same-day memory traces for next-day retrieval.

> NREM sleep spindles for example have been shown to be important for consolidation [34] and more recently encoding/learning capabilities.

> in opposition to a dichotomous view associating a specific sleep stage with a specific type of memory, it has also been postulated that the sequence in which phases appear in normal sleep, i.e. NREMREM succession, could be more important for optimal consolidation

> replay happens during the first 15-30min of sleep, when mammals are in SWS. During this SWS period, reactivated circuits undergo synaptic consolidation according to replay hypothesis, while others could be pruned according to the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis (see below). One could speculate that both hypotheses are not exclusive and that replay mechanisms could be important to protect fragile circuits against global synaptic downscaling.

> sleep is believed to consolidate synaptic connections required for encoding and retention of memories.

> Further, cortical consolidation was found correlated with the amount of NREM [51]. This finding suggests that sleep, especially NREM, has a critical function in cortical synaptic remodeling.

> the Synaptic Homeostasis Hypothesis (SHH), has emerged postulating that sleep globally downscales all synapses to compensate for the net increase in synapse formation and strength during wake

> modulation of network activity leads to the uniform scaling of synaptic strength across groups of synapses or entire neurons [74, 75]. This allows neurons to normalize their output without changing the relative signaling strength of individual synapses, thus presumably maintaining the information fidelity of the system.

> ...reduces the physical footprint of memories without losing the details of that memory.

> slow (<1 Hz) potential oscillations

> oscillations in brain potentials are commonly considered to be mere epiphenomena that reflect synchronized activity arising from neuronal networks

> inducing slow oscillation-like potential fields by transcranial application of oscillating potentials (0.75 Hz) during early nocturnal non-rapid-eye-movement sleep, that is, a period of emerging slow wave sleep, enhances the retention of hippocampus-dependent declarative memories in healthy humans

> Brain stimulation with oscillations at 5 Hz--another frequency band that normally predominates during rapid-eye-movement sleep--decreased slow oscillations and left declarative memory unchanged.

## The memory function of sleep

> Sleep promotes primarily
the consolidation of memory, whereas memory encoding
and retrieval take place most effectively during waking



## Questions and insights

Sleep is a period where there is no external stimulation but plenty of
internal stimulation.

Learning gets encoded during sleep and maybe transformed into longer and
longer term memories.

More time asleep helps encode memories or reduce noise better (nap vs full night).

A global downscaling of all synapses seems to occur during sleep.

Duplicate synapses may get collapsed down to single synapses with more power to preserve the same effect with fewer synapses.

Generic waves of firing across the brain might help show unnecessary pathways or do something else.
