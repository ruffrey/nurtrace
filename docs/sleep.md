# Neurons, synapses, and sleep

Below is summarized some research regarding sleep and its effect on learning
or forgetting.

## https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3385863/

> Non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM) is characterized by high-voltage synchronized slow waves of electrical activity throughout the cortex, and is referred to as slow-wave sleep (SWS) in its most synchronized form.

> Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is characterized by rapid eye movement, muscle paralysis, and low-voltage irregular EEG waves similar to waves observed during wakefulness

> there is currently no clear evidence of an animal species that does not sleep

> the strongest experimental evidence supports a primary role for sleep in the regulation of brain plasticity and cognition.

> sleep promotes neural plasticity

> gains in memorization performance have also been reported after short sleep periods. Recall of events is stronger and more accurate after daytime nap as brief as a few minutes

>  SWS/NREM sleep deprivation after learning prevents subsequent consolidation and enhancement of memories. Consistent with this observation, stimulation of slow wave oscillations during sleep enhances the retention of same-day memory traces for next-day retrieval.

> NREM sleep spindles for example have been shown to be important for consolidation [34] and more recently encoding/learning capabilities.

> in opposition to a dichotomous view associating a specific sleep stage with a specific type of memory, it has also been postulated that the sequence in which phases appear in normal sleep, i.e. NREMREM succession, could be more important for optimal consolidation

> replay happens during the first 15-30min of sleep, when mammals are in SWS. During this SWS period, reactivated circuits undergo synaptic consolidation according to replay hypothesis, while others could be pruned according to the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis (see below). One could speculate that both hypotheses are not exclusive and that replay mechanisms could be important to protect fragile circuits against global synaptic downscaling.

> sleep is believed to consolidate synaptic connections required for encoding and retention of memories.

> Further, cortical consolidation was found correlated with the amount of NREM [51]. This finding suggests that sleep, especially NREM, has a critical function in cortical synaptic remodeling.

> the Synaptic Homeostasis Hypothesis (SHH), has emerged postulating that sleep globally downscales all synapses to compensate for the net increase in synapse formation and strength during wake

> modulation of network activity leads to the uniform scaling of synaptic strength across groups of synapses or entire neurons [74, 75]. This allows neurons to normalize their output without changing the relative signaling strength of individual synapses, thus presumably maintaining the information fidelity of the system.

> ...reduces the physical footprint of memories without losing the details of that memory.

> slow (<1 Hz) potential oscillations

> oscillations in brain potentials are commonly considered to be mere epiphenomena that reflect synchronized activity arising from neuronal networks

> inducing slow oscillation-like potential fields by transcranial application of oscillating potentials (0.75 Hz) during early nocturnal non-rapid-eye-movement sleep, that is, a period of emerging slow wave sleep, enhances the retention of hippocampus-dependent declarative memories in healthy humans

> Brain stimulation with oscillations at 5 Hz--another frequency band that normally predominates during rapid-eye-movement sleep--decreased slow oscillations and left declarative memory unchanged.

## The memory function of sleep

> Sleep promotes primarily
the consolidation of memory, whereas memory encoding
and retrieval take place most effectively during waking

> Consolidation involves the active re-processing of ‘fresh’
memories within the neuronal networks that were used
for encoding them. It seems to occur most effectively
off-line, i.e. during sleep, so that encoding and consolidation
cannot disturb each other

> Effects of a 3-hour period of sleep on
emotional memory were even detectable 4 years later

> sleep occurring 3 hours after learning
was more effective than sleep delayed by more than
10 hours

> The most prominent field potential oscillations during SWS
are the slow oscillations, spindles and sharp wave-ripples,
whereas REM sleep is characterized by ponto-geniculooccipital
(PGO) waves and theta activity. The slow oscillations
originate in the neocortex with a peak frequency (in humans)
of ~0.8 Hz130,164. They synchronize neuronal activity into
down-states of widespread hyperpolarization and neuronal
silence and subsequent up-states, which are associated with
depolarization and strongly increased, wake-like neuronal
firing

> There is strong evidence for an active consolidating
influence of sleep from behavioural studies,
which indicate that sleep can lead to qualitative changes
in memory

> after sleep subjects more easily solved
a logical calculus problem that they were unable to solve
before sleep or after corresponding intervals of wakefulness46.
of note, sleep facilitated the gain of insight into
the problem only if adequate encoding of the task was
ensured before sleep

> Re-organization of memory representations
during sleep also promotes the transformation of
implicit into explicit knowledge

> disengagement
of memory systems is an essential characteristic of sleepdependent
consolidation49. This idea derives mainly
from experiments showing that declarative learning of
words immediately after training of a procedural skill
can block off-line improvement in that skill if the subject
does not sleep between learning and re-testing, but not if
the subject sleeps between learning and re-testing

> pharmacological
suppression of REM sleep by administration of antidepressant
drugs (selective noradrenaline or serotonin
re-uptake inhibitors) did not impair consolidation of
procedural memory56, which is in agreement with clinical
observations that antidepressant treatment does not
affect memory function57. However, such substances also
exert direct effects on synaptic plasticity and synaptic
forms of consolidation that could compensate for a loss
of REM sleep

> there is evidence that REM sleep preferentially benefits
the consolidation of emotional aspects of a memory

> SWS-rich, early sleep
consistently benefits the consolidation of declarative
memories12,13,59, whereas REM-rich sleep benefits nondeclarative
types of memory (that is, procedural and
emotional aspects of memory)

> Texture discrimination also improved
following a short midday nap of 60–90 minutes containing
solely SWS, but more so if the nap included
both SWS and REM sleep

>  in rats the spatio-temporal patterns of neuronal
firing that occur in the hippocampus during exploration
of a novel environment or simple spatial tasks are
re-activated in the same order during subsequent sleep

> neuronal re-activation of ensemble activity mostly
occurs during SWS (it is rarely observed during REM
sleep76,77) and during the first hours after learning (but
see Ref. 78), and typically only in a minority of recorded
neurons

> unlike re-activations that occur
during wakefulness, re-activations during SWS almost
always occur in the order in which they were experienced

> Re-exposure to the odour during SWS, but not
REM sleep, enhanced the spatial memories and
induced stronger hippocampal activation than during
wakefulness

> reactivations
during system consolidation stimulate the
redistribution of hippocampal memories to neocortical
storage sites

two-stage model

> one store allows learning at a fast rate and
serves as an intermediate buffer that holds the
information only temporarily; the other store learns at
a slower rate and serves as the long-term store.

> Hebbian plasticity
Refers to the functional
changes at synapses that
increase the efficacy of
synaptic transmission and
occurs when the presynaptic
neuron repeatedly and
persistently stimulates the
postsynaptic neuron.

> Spike-time dependent
plasticity
Refers to the functional
changes at synapses that alter
the efficacy of synaptic
transmission depending on the
relative timing of pre- and
postsynaptic firing (‘spiking’).
The synaptic connection is
strengthened if the presynaptic
neuron fires shortly before the
postsynaptic neuron, but is
weakened if the sequence of
firing is reversed.

Concise and informative regarding cell and synapse growth.

> Figure 9.6
Axon fasciculation. The pioneer axon (blue) serves as a
scaffold for the outgrowth of the new axon from another
cell (purple).

> Figure 9.7
Attractive forces produced by diffusable factors, serve
to direct axons to their appropriate targets.

> A more likely option was suggested by Sperry in his Chemoaffinity
Hypothesis that suggests that positional information is encoded in
the form of gradients of signaling molecules at the target which
would be detected by complementary gradients of receptors on the axons.

> The growth of developing axons depends on:
1. Physical guidance cues such as guidepost cells and pioneer axons.
2. Local and long-range molecules involved in attraction and repulsion
of developing axons (the presence of which substantiates the
chemoaffinity hypothesis of Sperry).
3. The presence of receptors on developing axons that allow for modulation of growth by environmental factors.

(important)
> A growth cone matures into a presynaptic axon terminal.
As an axon grows toward its target, its growth cone plays a role in
"sensing" attractive and repulsive forces in its local environment.
After the axon has reached its target, the terminal matures by altering
its shape, the localization of vesicles, and the protein machinery
necessary for regulated and constitutive, rather than solely constitutive,
secretion. These dramatic changes allow the axon terminal to provide
efficient synaptic transmission.

Receptors become more dense when an axon terminal is nearby, to receive its
neurotransmitters.

#### 9.17 Neuronal Survival/Synapse Elimination

Synapses consolidate over time such that fewer weaker axon terminals
grow into a single strong terminal.

> It is not clear why, but it seems that more synapses are created than are eventually required for proper neuronal function.

> those <synapses> that are simply redundant are removed

> Cell death has been suggested to be the default pathway for all cells, and cells that escape do so by receiving appropriate trophic support.

> In many cases if a synapse is not formed, or if an incorrect synapse is made, then the presynaptic neuron will eventually die.

NGF = nerve growth factor

> Competition for NGF occurs when multiple axons innervate a single target that has limited amounts of NGF. Innervating axons possess NGF receptors that bind, internalize, and retrogradely transport NGF. The biochemical cascade produced by NGF internalization and transport results in signals that prevent cell death.

## Questions and insights

Sleep is a period where there is no external stimulation but plenty of
internal stimulation.

Learning gets encoded during sleep and maybe transformed into longer and
longer term memories.

More time asleep helps encode memories or reduce noise better (nap vs full night).

A global downscaling of all synapses seems to occur during sleep.

Duplicate synapses may get collapsed down to single synapses with more power to preserve the same effect with fewer synapses.

Generic waves of firing across the brain might help show unnecessary pathways or do something else.

There are several stages of sleep. Each is associated with different wave oscillations. Consolidation is different during different stages.

SWS seems to be where declarative memory is moved to long term or consolidated. REM seems to be similar but for procedural memory.

Axons may be more or less likely to grow based on the presence of certain receptors.

Axons start in a growth stage, with a growth cone on the end, then upon reaching their target,
matures into an efficient terminal.

Chemoattraction by neurons or intracellar devices probably creates gradients of attractive and repulsive forces that guide growing axons.

Target cells give off nerve growth factor (NGF) that keeps presynaptic cells from dying. presynaptic cells compete for NGF.

Spike-time dependent plasticity is not represented in the library currently. Where
a presynaptic cells firing right before postsynaptic cells are reinforced.
