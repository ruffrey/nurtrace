# continuous-time recurrent neural networks

It is possible this is a CTRNN implementation.

- time-based firings
- has *adaptation algorithm*
- training on *unknown dynamical systems*

# spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP)

A biological process that adjusts the strength of connections between neurons in the brain

# liquid state machine
