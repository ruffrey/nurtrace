# Mechanisms of learning

- Start with a fully random set of cells and syanpses.
- Assign inputs and outputs to cells.
- Forge a path of neurons/synapses from each input to its output.
    - one input firing should trigger the output to fire.
- Measure learning at different kinds of success:
    - firing one input unit produces output unit firing
    - firing a group of input units produces a group of output unit firing
    - firing a group of input units produces a group of out units *in the right order*
- When firing was successful:
    - don't lose it
    - reinforce all synapses that fired on the path from the input to the output cell
- When firing was not successful:
    - forge a strong path through the network from the input to the output cell
    - reinforce all synapses along the way
- Reducing noise:
    - traverse the network from each expected output back to each input cell
    - mark each synapse/cell on the happy path
    - traverse the network from each unexpected output back to each input cell
    - mark each synapse/cell on the bad path
    - to make the network learn:
        - add inhibitory synapses to bad path cells
        - reinfoce good synapses
        - when synapses hit the max voltage, add another synapse in the same direction
- Pruning:
    - it is unclear the best way to do pruning, or if it is necessary
    - cells with no synapses get pruned
    - Do not prune cells or synapses during a diff.
    - it means we cannot really add parts of networks together
    - pruning's purpose is *to remove noise*
    - *only prune on the main network*   
    - perhapse only prune non-fired synapses at the end of a large training session or several training sessions
