# A Network of Networks

In an organism there are many networks.

In a network, the inputs and outputs are **base units**.

There is no reason an outer network cannot use the inner network.

Take words prediction with a given seed:

    input 1   -   what time do you open?

    input 2   -   a d e h i m n o p t u w y ?    - character layer

    network   -   < a shit load of magical cells and synapses >

    output 1  -   3 m p                          - character layer

    output 2  -   3pm

You can just keep nesting networks.

There is no reason we cannot mash networks together, also.
