### Pattern Recognition in a Bucket

> generic cortical architecture capable of universal real-time computation, which could potentially be specified by relatively few genetic parameters, so long as a “separation property” could be achieved

> The separation property requires that separation between the trajectories of internal states of the system is roughly proportional to the distances between two different input streams that caused them.

A random-ish mass of cells and synapses must have the *separation
property* - given two paths firing in a network, those paths should
be roughly different in an equivalent capacity as their inputs.

Training occurs on a set of listeners called *readout elements* which
are a layer of cells connected to the rest of the network, but considered
to be a different section by convention.

> In our system the perceptron must use only real-time wave dynamics to make a stable classification.

In a system using actual water ^^
