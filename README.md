# Name Pending

This is a real neural network, modeled after real neuring firing patterns.

It uses the concept of the Action Potential and Membrane Potential from neuroscience to
train a neural network.

## Goals
- simple math resembling millivolts in neural network firings
- fast and works cross platform
- parallelized learning and inputs - instead of only training on one thing at a time, can train
on more than one stimuli simultaneously
- can also train in parallel on the same dataset
- focus is on the pathway, rather than the neural network solving only one problem

## Stretch Goals
- generalized model can be used for any kind of data that can be put in memory
- same network can be trained on more than one kind of stimuli to solve different problems
