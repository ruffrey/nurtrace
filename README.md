# Name Pending

This is a real neural network, modeled after real neuring firing patterns.

It uses the concept of the Action Potential and Membrane Potential from neuroscience to
train a neural network.

## Core lib architected to support:

[x] simple math resembling millivolts in neural network firings
[ ] fast and works cross platform
[x] can train in parallel on the same dataset
[x] parallelized learning and inputs
    - instead of only training on one thing at a time, can train on more than one
    stimuli simultaneously
[x] focus is on the pathway, rather than the neural network solving only one problem
[x] generalized model can be used for any kind of data that can be put in memory
[x] same network can be trained on more than one kind of stimuli to solve different problems
[ ] methods for adaptive learning - training evaluates its learning speed and adjusts

## Stretch Goals

[ ] Provides tools for easy distributed training across computers
[ ] Visualize network changing over time
[ ] Prebuilt network training for:
    [ ] character and word recurrent neural networks
    [ ] image classification
[ ] Tools for measuring training speed
[ ] Cross platform GUI app for all of it
